# Project : Zomato Dataset Analysis
## Overview
-	This repository showcases my data analysis project performed using MySQL on the zomato dataset. 
-	It consists of several flat files such as: `products.csv`, `sales.csv` etc, which were used to gain insights and perform various analysis on it. 
## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of the following files:
-	`products.csv`: This file contains information about the different food items available on Zomato, including their names, prices etc.
-	`sales.csv`: This file provides data on the sales made on Zomato, including the user who made the purchase, the product purchased, the quantity, and the order date.
-	`users.csv`: This file contains details about the users of Zomato, including their names, contact information, etc.
